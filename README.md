# Wallet firewall

Wallet firewall is a firewall built between wallet and dapp, it can help us to observe the requests between dapp and wallet, 

on top of that we can add some protection rules like: if we find dapp request `setApprovalForAll`, and the domain name of dapp is not in the domain whitelist, remind the user to confirm the risk, etc.
